PFEC is a community-owned organization for theatre producers and enthusiasts. It is a platform where theatre producers and theatre enthusiasts can share in the creation, funding, and profit of immersive theatre productions. 

Today, theatre funding takes two forms: either as a grant to a nonprofit or as a for-profit investment. Despite the popularity and devoted patronage, theatre productions are largely either unprofitable and underfunded or profitable with little going back to the creators or the supportive patrons. PFEC is creating a third, flexible funding source for innovative new productions while rewarding early supporters. 

Our members are those who are deeply passionate about theatre and believe in an equitable, experimental, and prosperous future for the performing arts – one that is owned and governed by the people who love it most.

We are a digital cooperative. PFEC is democratically controlled, funded, and managed by a group of individuals who collectively own it. 

PFEC is based in New York and has members from across the globe – Berlin, Tokyo, Paris, Seoul, and Los Angeles.
