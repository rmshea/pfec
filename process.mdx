To submit your show or creative project to PFEC, you must submit an initial Google Form application. Once accepted, your project will go to vote at the next voting checkpoint (1st or 16th of the month). If your project fails, it can be resubmitted up to two times.

Members will participate in approving the projects that PFEC allocates funding towards. Members have one vote per membership. Stewards are responsible for overseeing this process and ensuring it is executed in a fair and just way. Stewards have the responsibility of ensuring the process is clearly communicated to all members and to adjusting the process should a better one emerge. All voting history and proposal history will be available to the community here.
