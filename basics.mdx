To join People's Spotlight and vote on decisions, members must contribute at least $60 annually.

Benefits to People's Spotlight, on top of voting rights, include perks such as the following:

1.	Early access to People's Spotlight shows
2.	Discount on tickets 
3.	Access to members-only conferences/parties/gatherings 
4.	Opportunity to co-create shows with producers 
5.	Access or use of shared performances places

Under the hood, People's Spotlight is a multi-class hybrid cooperative that has two distinct classes of
ownership and governance. Owners are able to participate in multiple
membership classes at once. However, each member will have one vote per
membership. All members are owners in the co-op which means they have
the right to profit sharing, governance [decision-making and voting
power], and other membership perks.

expected to give your feedback in the form of voting, governance, and
consultation on each project that engages with People's Spotlight.

You may also receive things like discounts to shows (or other places
that the cooperative deems valuable), merchandise from shows, and more.

### Contributor 

Overview of a Contributor Member:

Are you a theater nerd, community manager, project coordinator, brand
expert, or just an all-around useful badass looking to actively
participate in running the cooperative or executing the cooperative's
ongoing productions?

This is the membership for you.

Contributor members work directly on productions as well as other
activities that will make People's Spotlight successful over the long term: marketing,
PR, community building, and logistics/operations. You are the lifeblood
of the cooperative. You'll work directly with the Stewards, leadership
team, and any other committees that the cooperative may put into place
to bring theatre to the masses. You will be entitled to compensation and
you will have ownership rights within the co-op. Your voice will be
heard and valued in the decision-making and governance of the co-ops
treasury. The process of Contributor members will be shaped and
implemented by the Stewards.

Responsibilities as a Contributor Member:

-   You actively "work" on initiatives as outlined by the Stewards (or by an elected committee) for a minimum of 3 hours per week.
