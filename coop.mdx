title: "What is a co-op?"
---

A co-op, short for "cooperative", is a type of organization that is owned and operated by its members, who share in the profits and decision-making of the organization.
In a co-op, the members typically work together to achieve common goals and meet common needs, such as purchasing goods and services, marketing their products, or other community services. Several main values of cooperatives are:

1. Collaborative decision-making: In a co-op, members have an equal say in how the organization is run and how productions are created.
2. Shared resources: Co-ops are designed to share resources, which can be especially beneficial for immersive theater productions that require a variety of specialized skills and materials.
3. Collective ownership: Co-ops are owned and run by their members, which can foster a sense of shared ownership and responsibility.
4. Flexibility: Co-ops can be structured in a variety of ways, which can provide a great deal of flexibility for immersive theater productions.
5. Long-term sustainability: Co-ops are often designed to be sustainable over the long term, which can be especially important for immersive theater productions that may have a limited run or may require a great deal of investment upfront.
