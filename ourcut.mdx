For each show, we structure our support in different ways. Generally, People's Spotlight takes single digit percentages of the backend after the initial grant is paid back, and funds shows up to 25k. 

When a show is submitted, you can add information about your preferred funding structure, and can provide information about any existing legal entities that will make signing the documents easier.
