Being an owner in PFEC means you are able to participate in decision making around what shows will be funded from the treasury. The process is simple: members pledge funds (minimum $60), vote twice-a-month on shows to support, and share in the profits for successful shows. 

There will be 24 annual votes on new projects (on the 1st and 16th of the month) and we will use a voting process called conviction voting. 

This process allows PFEC members to evaluate all nominated proposals at any given time.
