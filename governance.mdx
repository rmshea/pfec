title: "Governance"
---

Being an owner in PFEC means you are able to participate in decision making around what shows will be funded from the treasury. The process is simple: members pledge funds (minimum $60), vote twice-a-month on shows to support, and share in the profits for successful shows. 

There will be 24 annual votes on new projects (on the 1st and 16th of the month) and we will use a voting process called conviction voting. 

This process allows PFEC members to evaluate all nominated proposals at any given time. You can distribute your governance weight according to the proposals that you want to put your power behind. The longer you hold a preference for any individual proposal, the more weight you give to that preference over time (up to a certain limit). 

In PFEC, a member gains more “governance” weight depending on the amount that is pledged (ie. contributions above $60 would have more weight than $60). 

By using conviction voting, the system is designed to reward underlying belief in a proposal as opposed to the wealth of any individual member. 

To learn more about conviction voting read this PFEC is a community-owned organization for theatre producers and enthusiasts. It is a platform where theatre producers and theatre enthusiasts can share in the creation, funding, and profit of immersive theatre productions. 

Today, theatre funding takes two forms: either as a grant to a nonprofit or as a for-profit investment. Despite the popularity and devoted patronage, theatre productions are largely either unprofitable and underfunded or profitable with little going back to the creators or the supportive patrons. PFEC is creating a third, flexible funding source for innovative new productions while rewarding early supporters. 

Our members are those who are deeply passionate about theatre and believe in an equitable, experimental, and prosperous future for the performing arts – one that is owned and governed by the people who love it most.

We are a digital cooperative. PFEC is democratically controlled, funded, and managed by a group of individuals who collectively own it.
